Android app created on 24 hours hackathon by Google Developer Groups with <a href = "https://github.com/vinfred/">Myroslava Kachan </a>.

It's a social app, which allows users to create some projects which might be useful for the society e.g. cleaning a park, gathering clothes for homeless people etc. People may create such projects, mark them on a map, attach some photos to illustrate the problem and then share it to other people. If a person wants to help, he can search for the nearest projects to his current location, and see if he's interested in the project or not. If the answer is positive then he can decide how he'd like to help - either by participating in the activity or by donating some money. There can also be a discussion on each project, as well as the progress of completing it. 

The app is kind of a mess (a tiny little bit), as it was hacked in solely 24 hours.
